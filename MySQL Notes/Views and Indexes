--* Views 
-- a virtual table based on the results-set of an SQL statement
-- The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in a database 
-- They're not real tables but can be interacted with as if they were a real table 

CREATE VIEW employee_attendance AS SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees;
SELECT * FROM employee_attendance ORDER BY last_name ASC;
DROP VIEW employee_attendance;

----------------------------------------------------------------

ALTER  TABLE customers ADD COLUMN emails VARCHAR(100);
UPDATE customers SET emails = "Puff@gmail.com" WHERE customer_id = 4;

CREATE VIEW customer_emails AS SELECT emails FROM customers;

-----------------------------------------------------------------
INSERT INTO customers VALUES ( 5, "Pearl","Perry",NULL,"Perry@gmail.com");
--and now we don't have to update the VIEWS and it will update itself and add the values of the new email

--* INDEX (BTree data structure)
-- indexes are used to find values within a specific column more quickly
-- MySQL normally searches sequentially through a column 
-- the longer the column , the more expensive the operation is 
-- UPDATE takes more time , SELECT takes less time 

/*A B-tree (also known as a B-tree or B+-tree) is a self-balancing 
search tree data structure that is commonly used in database systems to 
store and retrieve data efficiently.*/


CREATE INDEX last_name_idx ON customers(last_name);
--since we'll be doing a lot of searching with last name so to make it quick we add a index on it 

SHOW INDEX FROM customers;

--now what if we wanna add both the first and last name 
CREATE INDEX lastName_firstName ON customers(last_name, first_name);

--lets delete the index named last_name_idx
DROP INDEX last_name_idx ON customers;

--* ROLLUP
-- extension of a GROUP BY clause
-- produces another row and shows the GRAND TOTAL (super-aggregate value)

SELECT SUM(amount), time_of_pay FROM transactions GROUP BY time_of_pay;

--now this above will give the total amount of each year but i want a grand total at the end so 
SELECT SUM(amount), time_of_pay FROM transactions GROUP BY time_of_pay WITH ROLLUP;

--ex
SELECT COUNT(transaction_id), time_of_pay FROM transactions GROUP BY time_of_pay WITH ROLLUP;
-- this above shows the total amount of transactions happened

SELECT SUM(hourly_pay) , employee_id FROM employees GROUP BY employee_id WITH ROLLUP;

--*ON DELETE SET NULL
--now during table making , we can set ON DELETE NULL ,but lets just alter the table for now
ALTER TABLE transactions ADD CONSTRAINT fk_transactions_customer_id FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) 
REFERENCES customers(customer_id) ON DELETE SET NULL;

--* ON DELETE CASCADE
--now this will remove the whole row 
ALTER TABLE transactions ADD CONSTRAINT fk_transactions_customer_id FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) 
REFERENCES customers(customer_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

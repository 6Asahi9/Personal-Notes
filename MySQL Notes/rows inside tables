--now what if we haven't decided on a hourly pay and haven't hired him yet
INSERT INTO employees(employee_id, first_name, last_name, email)

--to update the employee pay and hire date where the employee_id is 3
UPDATE employees

    /*you can select multiple*/

--lets say i wanna look at all the name of the employees whose employee_id is a even number 
SELECT first_name, last_name, email

--or
SELECT first_name, last_name, email

--to delete an row 
DELETE FROM employees WHERE employee_id = 7;
--! make sure to use "where" and not just DELETE from employees or it will delete every row

--* Views 
-- a virtual table based on the results-set of an SQL statement
-- The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in a database 
-- They're not real tables but can be interacted with as if they were a real table 

CREATE VIEW employee_attendance AS SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees;
SELECT * FROM employee_attendance ORDER BY last_name ASC;
DROP VIEW employee_attendance;

ALTER  TABLE customers ADD COLUMN emails VARCHAR(100);
UPDATE customers SET emails = "Puff@gmail.com" WHERE customer_id = 4;

CREATE VIEW customer_emails AS SELECT emails FROM customers;

-----------------------------------------------------------------
INSERT INTO customers VALUES ( 5, "Pearl","Perry",NULL,"Perry@gmail.com");
--and now we don't have to update the VIEWS and it will update itself and add the values of the new email

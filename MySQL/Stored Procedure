--* Stored procedure 
-- it is a prepared SQL code that can save and its great if there's a query that you write often

SELECT DISTINCT first_name, last_name FROM transactions INNER JOIN customers
ON transactions.customer_id = customers.customer_id;
--lets say i write these two lines often so i can make SQL remember it and use it later for me

--lets start here  
CREATE PROCEDURE get_customer_names()
BEGIN
SELECT DISTINCT first_name, last_name FROM transactions INNER JOIN customers
ON transactions.customer_id = customers.customer_id
END;


-- now we use ; as a sign to say out statement ends here but what if we something like this
SELECT * FROM transactions;
--here here ; has it to say our statement ends here
--now when we create a procedure for it

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
--! THIS ONE DO NOT WORK
/*we can also use // instead of $$*/
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE get_transactions()
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM transactions;
END//

DELIMITER ;
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

--now SQL will only recognize the DELIMITER with ; and not the ; which is inside  

--to call it use 
CALL get_transactions;

--!tho will above one will give an error since DELIMITER is not working anymore so use 

CREATE PROCEDURE get_transactions()
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM transactions;
END;
--! this will work with two ; for some reason 

--and to drop it use 
DROP PROCEDURE get_transactions;

--*and in case you forgot the name of your procedure , use this 
SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS;

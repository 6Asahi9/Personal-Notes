--*SubQuery
--a Query within another query
--query(SubQuery)

--this will not only give the avg pay but also first and last name
SELECT first_name, last_name, hourly_pay, 
(SELECT AVG(hourly_pay) FROM employees) AS Avg_Pay 
FROM employees;

--now lets see how has more pay than average pay 
SELECT first_name, last_name, hourly_pay
FROM employees
WHERE hourly_pay >= (SELECT AVG(hourly_pay) FROM employees);        

-- use DISTINCT to remove any repeating word or statement
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM customers WHERE customer_id IN
(SELECT DISTINCT customer_id FROM transactions WHERE customer_id IS NOT NULL);

--*GROUP BY
--its an aggregate all rows by a specific column often used with aggregate functions 
-- ex. SUM(), MAX(), MIN(), AVG(), COUNT()

--this will the group amount of specified dates
SELECT SUM(amount), time_of_pay FROM transactions GROUP BY time_of_pay; 
SELECT MAX(amount), time_of_pay FROM transactions GROUP BY time_of_pay; 
SELECT MIN(amount), time_of_pay FROM transactions GROUP BY time_of_pay; 
SELECT AVG(amount), time_of_pay FROM transactions GROUP BY time_of_pay; 
SELECT COUNT(amount), time_of_pay FROM transactions GROUP BY time_of_pay; 

--this will also show the customer id with Sum amount too
SELECT SUM(amount), customer_id FROM transactions GROUP BY customer_id;

--! now GROUP BY doesn't work with WHERE so instead use HAVING , this will work the same thing 
SELECT COUNT(amount), customer_id FROM transactions 
GROUP BY customer_id HAVING COUNT(amount) > 1 AND customer_id IS NOT NULL;

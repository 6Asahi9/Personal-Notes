--now lets say we deleted the whole table by accident 
-- what we can do it create a save point 
SET AUTOCOMMIT = OFF; /*this will make it so changes wont commit themselves*/

SAVEPOINT save_point_1;
--!need to keep AUTOCOMMIT set to OFF when you create a savepoint.

-- then we delete the whole table by "accident"
DELETE FROM employees;

-- and then we rollback to the save point
ROLLBACK TO save_point_1;
COMMIT;
/*The COMMIT statement in SQL is used to save the changes made to the database.
 When AUTOCOMMIT is set to OFF, SQL does not automatically commit changes. This 
 means that changes made to the database are not saved until you explicitly issue 
 a COMMIT statement*/
